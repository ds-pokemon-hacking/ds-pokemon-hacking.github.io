town map overlay 101 interactions

a144_4_10.ncgr is town map
a144_4_11.nscr is mapping
a144_4_23.nclr is palette


each row is 64 tiles long, mahogany town red is y 6 x a

gray is y 1c x 5



let's figure this out

021E8381 - loads 04


check out spreadsheet for 21F79B4 (replace red with gray)

check out spreadsheet for orange assignments (put the orange transparency over it)

town map boundaries - 2,2 to 25,17, x >= 22 seems to be kanto

kanto coord is at 307C (021EA7BC) - originally 16

map names are all in 279, 273 has the map descriptions

21EB6E8 reads x coord
21EB71C reads max?
21E7A80


set max map coords at 021F7358/FC18
107FC as well?

reads poke gear progress bits
021EAF86
021ED9C6 seems to advance the state

nop out 3 instructions at 3846/021EAF86 of overlay 101--now no map replacement with way over yonder at 48,0
38D6/ 021EB016 of overlay 101 - need to nop this out too? progress check on red x check.  yes.
38E2 - nop this out too to make the game redo its whole thing.  functions like a charm.



still need to worry about the fly map--
_021EA7BC appears to have a check against 0x16--already found this

functions that use ov101_021F79B4

ov101_021EA4D0 - not suspect tbh
021EA5A2 (2E62) - 23 D0 - catches the animation, but relies on method below

ov101_021EA81C - if r1 is less than redX then continue loop?
021EA828 (30E8) - A0 79


ov101_021EA8A8 - not suspect?  sets anim tho
021EB016 (38D6) - already found this one


ov101_021EA804 - seems to be routine to determine whether or not its flyable
(30C4) - 08 B5 3A 29
replace with
01 20 70 47
