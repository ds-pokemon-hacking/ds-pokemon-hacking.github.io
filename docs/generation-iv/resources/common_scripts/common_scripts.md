# Common Scripts

Common scripts are used in Generation IV Pokemon games to repeatedly call scripted behaviour from "local" script files. Although they are referred to (using DSPRE's scripting nomenclature) using common script IDs, they are simple scripts within script files. One difficulty with working with them, is that these script files do not have a header to easily find the associated Text Archive.  

The mapping tables in these pages (per game version) allows quick lookup of the Common Script ID, to find the script being used (in a given Script File), and the texts that may be invoked (from a given Text Archive).
